\section{Introduction}
The Gator Taxi System is a sophisticated ride-hailing application designed to efficiently manage and process ride requests. Utilizing advanced data structures such as the Min Heap and Red-Black Tree (RBT), the system offers an optimized approach for handling ride allocations and driver assignments. This project demonstrates the practical application of these data structures in a real-world scenario, showcasing their effectiveness in optimizing operations and improving overall service quality.

\section{Objectives}
The primary objectives of the Gator Taxi System are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To efficiently manage ride requests and driver allocations.
    \item To demonstrate the practical use of Min Heaps and Red-Black Trees in a real-world application.
    \item To provide a user-friendly interface for both riders and drivers.
    \item To ensure timely and efficient ride services.
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation and Setup}
To set up the Gator Taxi System, follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clone the repository from GitHub:
    \begin{verbatim}
    git clone git@github.com:Vveanta/GatorTaxiSystem.git
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Navigate to the cloned directory:
    \begin{verbatim}
    cd GatorTaxiSystem
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from \url{https://www.python.org/downloads/}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Running the Code}
To run the Gator Taxi System, execute the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open a terminal or command prompt in the GatorTaxiSystem directory.
    \item Use the Makefile to compile and run the program:
    \begin{verbatim}
    make run input_file_name=input.txt
    \end{verbatim}
    \item The system will process the input file and generate an output in "output_file.txt".
\end{enumerate}

\section{Usage}
\subsection{Input Format}
The input file (e.g., "input.txt") should contain ride requests in the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
<RequestID> <PickupTime> <PickupLocation> <DropoffLocation> <RiderID>
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Output Format}
The output file ("output_file.txt") will include the details of ride allocations:
\begin{verbatim}
<RequestID> <DriverID> <PickupTime> <DropoffTime>
\end{verbatim}
